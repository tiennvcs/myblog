> **There are, however, some arguments that oppose** the importance of high earnings, which is the most important part in occupations. **The most typical of these is** other more important factors, namely safety at work, or enthusiasm. Many jobs offer a high salary in order to serve dangerous cases, are able to inflict a sense of insecurity and unease on workers. On the other hand, some employees, who are involved in positions which do not bring to them the confort and interest in work, wil be unproductive compared to their devoting counterparts. **Therefore**, these factors will impact how long employees stay loyal to the companies and how strong their dedication to working.

> **Personally, I am strongly of the opinion that** the highly-praised importance of money **is *disadvantageous* in some certain aspects**. **The most conclusive evidence emphasizes** the prospects of career leaps. A high salary earning is normally the most desirable factor when it comes to jobs, but people are extremely concerned about how their career develops.
