**To begin with, in writing task I in the IELTS exam, we start with dealing with basic question types: given a chart whose figures change over time and our mission is to summarize the information and make relevant comparisons.**

## Question, outline, and essential sentence structures
---
*You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.*

**The graph below show the average carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_\text{2}$) emissions per person in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Portugal between 1967 and 2007.** 

**Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.**

*Write at least 150 words.*

![Average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per person, 1967-2007](/media/image/ielts/writing_task_i/average_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_person.jpg)

There are 4  scoring criteria in writing task I: task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy. And you must write your answer under a passage containing several paragraphs and no lesser than 150 words. Here is my outline for tackling this kind of question.

1. Introduction section
    - a single paragraph that mentions the issue in the question again.
2. Overview section
   - a single paragraph overview of the typical features (general, highest values, lowest values) in given figures. 
3. Body section
   - several (at least two) paragraphs detailly describing figures in the chart.

And I will use these sentences below to write my answer.

**Introductory section**
> The graph/chart illustrates/describes/presents + **...synonym of object of question...** + time/place (period). 

**Overview section**
> From an overall perspective, **...name of the chart/object of question** + all varied with different proportions.

**Body section**
    
  - Remember, **the lines/bars with similar trends should be described together** (in the same paragraph).
  - The lines/bars should be **divided into different stages**.
  - If two lines have a similar trend, use "**Similarly/Likewise**" to link two sentences.
  - Otherwise, utilize "**By contrast/On the contrary**" to link two sentences.
  - Using "**Afterwards/And then/Followed by/Before + $V_{ing}$...**"
  - To point out the maximum or minimum values, using "**which occupied/accounted for the highest/lowest proportion**".


So this is my outline before writing the answer.
>  The chart describes the average CO2 emissions per person in four European nations from 1967 to 2007.
>
> From an overall perspective, **...name of the chart/object of question** + all varied with different proportions. In that, **1st group** generally dropped, whereas **2nd group** significantly/enormously/gently/consistently rose.   

**Describe the dropping group (1st group)**
> To be more specfic, **...1st line in 1st group...**. Similarly, **2nd line in 1st group**.
>
**Describe the increasing group (2nd group)**
> By contrast, **...1st line in 2nd group...**. Likewise, **2nd line in 2nd group**.

Therefore, we need to recognize groups of lines having similar increases or decreases in general. When describing a group, you should divide them into separate stages and illustrate the change of each line in this group in each stage.

In the given figures, we can gather the UK and Sweden into a group, Italy and Portugal into a group. In the first group, all lines have decreasing trend, generally, whereas the second group has an increasing trend. We can divide the line of Sweden in the first group into two separate stages: from 1967 to 1977 and from 1977 to 2007 and a description of the UK from 1967 to 2007. Similarly, the second group could be split into two phases: between 1967 and 1997, and between 1977 and 2007.

And one thing needs to remember, **you should use the past simple** to describe all changes in any stages in your answer.

## Structures for the body section
---
As you can see, writing the introductory and overview section is not hard and our key here is describing the changes, accurately and reasonably.

1. The name of the line/bar + (adverb) + verb + from + data (in + time) + to + data (in + time) + (between + time).

   **Example:** *The average carbon dioxide emissions per person in the United Kingdom consistently decreased from 11 tonnes in 1967 to 9 tonnes in 2007.*
   
   Or we can write, *The average carbon dioxide emissions per person in the United Kingdom slightly decreased from 11 tonnes to 9 tonnes between 1967 and 2007.*

2. There was + a/an + adjective + noun + in + name of the line/bar + from + data + to + data + between + time.

   **Example:** *The was a dramatic growth in the average carbon dioxide emissions per individual in Sweden from 9 tones to 11 tones between 1967 and 1977.*

3. The name of the line/bar + saw/experienced/witnessed + a/an + adjective + noun + from + data + to + data + between + time.

   **Example:** *Afterwards, the average CO2 emitted in Sweden witnessed a significant drop from 11 tones in 1977 to 5 tones in 2007.*

   **Positive meaning sentence**
4. The name of the line/bar + benefited from/enjoyed + a/an + adjective + noun + from + data + to + data + between + time.

   **Example:** *And then, the average CO2 emitted in Sweden benefited from a significant drop from 11 tones in 1977 to 5 tones in 2007.*

   **Negative meaning sentence**
5. The name of the line/bar + suffered from/underwent + a/an +  adjective + noun + from + data + to + data + between + time.

   **Example:** *By contrast, the average CO2 exhaust fumes in Italy suffered from a considerable rise from approximately 4 tones to 8 tones between 1967 and 1997.*


6. The statistics/The report/The survey + on + name of the line + indicated/revealed + a + adjective + noun + from + data + to + data.

   **Example:** *Similarly, the statistics on average CO2 generated in Portugal revealed a remarkable increase from 1 tone to 5 tones between 1967 and 1997.*


## Complete answer
---

> The chart describes the average CO2 emissions per person in four European nations from 1967 to 2007.
>

> From an overall perspective, the average CO2 emissions of individuals in the UK, Sweden, Italy, and Portugal all varied with different proportions. In that, the amount of CO2 exhaust fumes in the UK and Sweden generally dropped, whereas emissions per person in Italy and Portugal significantly rose.
>

> To be more specific, the UK carbon dioxide consistently decreased from 11 tonnes, which accounted for the highest proportion, to 9 tonnes between 1967 and 2007. Similarly, there was a slight drop in average CO2 emissions in Sweden from 9 tonnes in 1967 to 10 tonnes in 1977. Afterward, it benefited from a remarkable fall from 10 tonnes to 5 tonnes between 1977 and 2007. 
>
> By contrast, the average CO2 exhaust fumes in Italy suffered from a considerable rise from approximately 4 tones to 8 tones between 1967 and 1997. And then, it stayed unchanged until 2007. Likewise, the statistics on average CO2 generated in Portugal revealed a remarkable increase from 1, which accounted for the lowest proportion, to 5 tones between 1967 and 1997. Finally, it witnessed an extremely minimal increase in the 1997-2007 period.
