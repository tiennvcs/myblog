### Question
*The map below shows the development of the village of Ryemouth between 1995 and the present.*
![Development of the village of Ryemouth between 1995 and the present](/media/image/ielts/writing_task_i/describe_process-development_village.png)

As you are supposed to describe the map, there are some key factors you should bear in mind.

- The directions (east/west/south/north/northeast/southeast/northwest/southwest)
- Adverb of place (on the right/on the left/ opposite/ next to/ behind/ along)
- **Describe the items that are removed first.**
- **Describe the items that are added next + (their supposed purpose)**
- **Describe the items that are converted last + (their supposed purpose)**
- **Always mention the remaining items (except mountains, sea, etc)**

Specially, we can easily find removed things on the map: *fishing port*. And these added at the present are
-  *car park* $\rightarrow$ the increasing parking need. 
  
These things converted:
- fish market $\rightarrow$ apartment $\rightarrow$ afford the accommadation for village.
- shop $\rightarrow$ restaurant $\rightarrow$ serve food for tourists.
- golf and tennis $\rightarrow$ farmland and forest park $\rightarrow$ create fresh air and entertainment place; farming products, e.g., vegetables.
- housing area $\rightarrow$ added land and more houses than past

These things sill not changed:
- cafe
- hotel
  
Our answer will be divided into 4 different paragraphs like below.
1. Introduction

    > First of all, **...decsribe the removed items...**
    >
    > By contrast, **...describe the added items...**
    >
    > On the other hand, **...describe part converted items...**
