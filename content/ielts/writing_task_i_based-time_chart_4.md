## Complete answer
---
> The graph illustrates the number of tourists travelling a specific Caribbean island in million unit between 2010 and 2017.

> From an overall perspective, the numbers of people visiting a Caribbean island all varied with different proportions in the 2010-2017 period. In that, there was a significant increase in numbers of people in all two visiting types, leading to the rise in total.

> To be more specific, the total number of tourists who visit a Caribbean island, and stay on this place, or on cruise, dramatically rose from 1 million to 3.5 million, which occupied the highest value in the report between 2010 and 2017.
>
> Similarly, there was a minimum increase in the number of people visiting and staying on this island from 0.25 million to 0.5 million between 2010 and 2011. After that, the number suffered from a slight fall from 0.5 million to 0.25 million. Afterwards, the Caribbean island benefited from a considerable growth in the numbers of tourists staying on the island from 0.25 million in 2012 to 2 million in 2017.
>
> By contrast, the number of visitors, staying on cruises, stayed stable at 0.75 million between 2010 and 2011. After that, there was a sharp increase in the number of tourists who stayed on cruises from 0.75 million to 1.5 million between 2011 and 2013. And then, the figures witnessed a fluctuating number of tourists in this group, which reached 1.5 millions at the end of this period, between 2013 and 2017.

**Bear in mind**

- number + **million/thousand/hundred** 

    $\rightarrow$ The population of the village is about **three thousand**.
    
    $\rightarrow$ They paid **three hundred thousand** for the house. 

- **millions/thousands/hundreds** + of + *plural nouns*

    $\rightarrow$ They spent thousands of dollars trying to fix the problem.

- number + **million/thousand/hundred** + of + *plural nouns*

    $\rightarrow$ There were approximately **four thousand foreigners** visiting Vietnam.

- **million/thousand/hundred** + of + *nouns*
    
    $\rightarrow$ A thousand people took part in the region's biggest-ever cycle race. 

    $\rightarrow$ Thirty thousand dollars a year doesn't go very far in the modern world. 

**CAN BE SIMPLE TO REMEMBER UNLESS WE ARE COUNTING THE NUMBERS (10 THOUSAND), IF *THOUSAND* IS THE PREVIOUS OF 1 NOUN, IT WILL PLAY A ROLE LIKE 1 ADJ, SO NEVER HAVE *S***
