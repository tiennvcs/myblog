**This post continually shows an agree/disagree question type in Writing task II.**

## Question and outline
**Question**

*Some people think that the best way to increase road safety is to increase the minimum legal age for driving cars or riding motorbikes. Do you agree or disagree with this belief?*

**Outline**

1. **Agree** $\rightarrow$ **write the introduction**: One of the most controversial issues today relates to the approval of increasing the minimum legal age for driving cars or riding motorbikes in order to ensure road safety. Personally, I strongly disagree with this belief.
2. **brainstorm 3 ideas, 3 reasons, and 3 results**.
   1. (**disagree**) the vital role of traffic laws $\rightarrow$ everyone comply with regulations,  many accidents from the older ages $\rightarrow$ seek alternatives
   2. (**disagree**) the quality of transport infrastructure $\rightarrow$ derelict constructions pose a high possibility of accidents $\rightarrow$ improve maintenance of infrastructure.
   3. (**agree**) the less impulse in the old $\rightarrow$ do not have childish reactions and be calm in solving accidents $\rightarrow$ more sense of security.
3. Write the body paragraphs one by one. Remember, don't considerably focus on paraphrasing the given statement to issue. 
4. **Write the conclusion paragraph**: In conclusion, I tend to suppose that this is a good belief. The government should remind the citizens of their responsibility for driving and strictly impose age-related regulations on the whole community, especially for the immature who are inclined to rebellion through their vehicles, should have been thoroughly educated about codes of behavior.

> **One of the most controversial issues today relates to** the approval of increasing the minimum legal age for driving cars or riding motorbikes in order to ensure road safety. **Personally, I strongly disagree with this belief**.

> **One of the strongest arguments against** the increase in driving age to improve road safety can be attributed to the vital role of traffic laws. **The main reason for believing this is** people, irrespective of their ages, should feel obliged to comply with regulations on road so that the safety of other drivers and their own should be unsured. The older ages do not equal to more proper awareness among people as many accidents, in reality, stem from the poor behavior of drivers of middle-or even advanced ages. **This can result in the fact that** government should seek some alternatives to the seemingly solution of imposing older age for driving license.
> 
>  **A further point which needs to be considered is** the quality of transport infrastructure, namely roads or highways, which largely determine the security of journeys. The derelict constructions serving the demand of travelling should pose high likelihood of accidents, some of which are startingly fatal or macabre, as risk of pile-ups or head-on crashes is imminent on pothole-riddled roads. **As a consequence**, the maintenance of infrastructure should be prioritized.
>
> **There are, however, some arguments that support** the increase in age of driving. **The most typical of these is** the less impulse found among individuals who are of more mature age. They should grow out of puerile reactions towards unexpected incidents or they undoubtedly display more composure in dealing with verbal abuse or road rage compared to their younger counterparts. **Therefore**, people can enjoy more sense of security as they share the lanes with drivers of maturity.

> **In conclusion, I tend to suppose that this is a bad belief. The government should** remind the citizens of their responsibility for driving and strictly impose age-related regulations on the whole community, especially for the immature who are inclined to rebellion through their vehicles, should have been thoroughly educated about codes of behavior.
