**Process description is one of the types of questions in IELTS writing task I. This post introduces step-by-step tackling this issue.**

## Question and outline
---
*The diagram below shows how banana chips are made.*

*Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.*

![How banana chips are made.](/media/image/ielts/writing_task_i/diagram_banana_chips.png)

Similar to other types of questions in Writing task II, the answer has 3 sections below.
1. Introductory section
   - A single-sentence restatement about the process given in the question.
   > The flowchart/diagram shows/illustrates the process by which **...raw material...** are turned into **...the final product...**.

2. Overview section
   - One sentence to describe the process, generally, and an additional sentence to indicate some important steps if could but it is not necessary.
   > In general, the process experiences a range of steps ranging from **...1st step...**. to **...last step...**. 

3. Body section 
   - Describe the process step-by-step by using the following structures.
     1. Name of the detail + is used/employed/deployed + to verb + raw material.
        
        **Example**: First, a machine is employed to peel the ripe and fresh bananas.

     2. (1) + Next/Afterwards/Then + raw material + be + transferred/brought to/moved to/placed on/placed in + name of the detail + which + verb + **...**.

        **Example**: First, a machine is employed to peel the ripe and fresh bananas. **Next, ripe and fresh bananas are placed in clean water which washes all dirt sticking to them.**

     3. (2) + and + the product/the outcome/the mixture + be + past participle + by + name of detail + (to/for) + **...**.

        **Example**: First, a machine is employed to peel the ripe and fresh bananas. Next, ripe and fresh bananas are placed in clean water which washes all dirt sticking to them **and the outcome is further cut into slices by a cutter for being easier to eat**.

## Step-by-step

There are 3 things we must find in describing a process/flowchart:
1. Raw material (usually in the 1st step).
2. Names of the details.
3. Verbs describing the functions of the details.

If possible, we should find the PURPOSE OF THE VERBS (to + verb/in order to/to serve the purpose of + $V_{ing}$)

With the specific problem above. These factors need to find will showed below.
- **Raw material**: ripe and fresh bananas
-  Details:
    1. machine $\rightarrow$ peel banana skins $\rightarrow$ save labour.
    2. clean water $\rightarrow$ wash dirt.
    3. cutter $\rightarrow$ cut it into slices being easier to eat.
    4. high-power light $\rightarrow$ dry.
    5. boiling oil $\rightarrow$ fry.
    6. iron grid $\rightarrow$ take it out.
    7. electric fan $\rightarrow$ cool it.
    8. spices $\rightarrow$ make it more delicious.
    9. assembly line $\rightarrow$ package.
    10. ship/plane $\rightarrow$ export worldwide

From the outline, we can easily write the body section.

> **The flowchart illustrates the process by which** bananas **are turned into** banana chips.
>

> **In general, the process experiences a range of steps ranging from** peeling skins **to** packing for export.

> First, a machine is deployed to peel the skins of ripe and fresh bananas and this can save labour. Next, ripe and fresh bananas are placed in clean water which washes all dirt sticking to them and the outcome is further cut into slices by a cutter for being easier to eat. Then, a high-power light is employed to dry. Afterwards, the outcome is placed in a boiling oil case which fries it to make it crispy taste, and the product is taken out by an iron grid. Then, an electric fan is used to gradually cool the product. Afterwards, the outcome is mixed with some spices which make these slices more delicious and the mixture is packaged into cans with the brand names by an assembly line. Finally, the product is worldwide exported by shipping services such as planes or ships.
